# shoorty
a very simple url shortener, made with bootstrap and codeigniter.
needs mysql. could also work with sqlite, but codeigniter has a bug concerning sqlite. 

- simply drop onto your server 
- create database (the file shoorty.sql might be helpful)
- edit application/config/database.php and change to your database settings
- Shoorten!!
